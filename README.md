# Guess-the-Number-Javascript
- This game has been made by me to get more practical knowledge of JavaScript or ES6. It has been made with the use of basic JS concepts like functions,
  variables,querySelecters,etc. This site also displays the HTML and CSS properties. This site is overall a simple example of how JavaScript can be used for webpages.
